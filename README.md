# Project_CUB200_with_ResNet_

Project_CUB200 is a dataset of images of birds for fine-grained recognition tasks. ResNet is a deep convolutional neural network architecture that has been widely used for image classification tasks. In this project, we will use ResNet to train a model on the CUB200 dataset.

Here are the steps to follow:

- Import the necessary libraries and load the dataset
- Define the ResNet model
- Define the loss function and optimizer
- Train the model
- Evaluate the model


This is a basic implementation of using ResNet for fine-grained recognition tasks using the CUB200 dataset. There are many ways to improve the model's performance, such as using data augmentation techniques, adjusting hyperparameters, and using a different model architecture.
